Currently, I am a Lead Data Scientist at Inside Tracker, leading the Data Science team to integrate blood biomarkers and DNA data with physiological data from activity trackers to improve lifestyle recommendations and discover new patterns and optimal zones in sleep, heart rate, and blood biomarkers. 

Prior to Inside Tracker, I was a research fellow at Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School where I worked as a bioinformatician developing statistical methods to study epigenetic mechanisms affecting gene expression. 

I have always been passionate about teaching and explaining complex concepts in simple terms. During my PhD, I developed and taught a course "R and application in bioinformatics". In 2013, this course was the first R course taught in Russia and was very popular among students. Since then, I taught R to students and professionals, in groups and individually. I am an RStudio Certified Instructor in tidyverse.
