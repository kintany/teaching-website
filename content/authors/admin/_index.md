Currently, I am a Senior Data Scientist at Nuna, developing ML-based trend algorithms and surfacing insights for users and healthcare providers.

Prior to Nuna, I worked at Zwift building recommendation models designed to offer personalized training and route suggestions for users, drawing from their historical time-series data.

Before that, I worked at InsideTracker where I focused on integrating blood biomarkers and DNA data with physiological data from activity trackers to improve lifestyle recommendations and discovering new patterns and optimal zones in sleep, heart rate, and blood biomarkers. 

I have always been passionate about teaching and explaining complex concepts in simple terms. During my PhD, I developed and taught a course "R and its application in bioinformatics". In 2013, this course was the first R course taught in Russia and was very popular among students. Since then, I taught R to students and professionals, in groups and individually. I am an RStudio Certified Instructor in tidyverse and teach at [posit Academy](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/academy/).
